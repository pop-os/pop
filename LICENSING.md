In general, it is preferred that Pop!\_OS projects are licensed `GPL-3.0-only`.
There are some exceptions to this:

- `MPL-2.0` may be used if it is desired to allow linkage with projects that use other licenses, but require modifications to remain open source
- `MIT OR Apache-2.0` may be used if it is desired to have wide use, with potential downstream modifications, in software of any license

To summarize: Use `GPL-3.0-only` for applications, `MPL-2.0` for libraries with utility in the open source community, and `MIT OR Apache-2.0` for foundational libraries with utility anywhere.
