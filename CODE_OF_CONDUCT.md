# Pop\!\_OS Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Pop\!\_OS community, we’re excited for your input!

Pop\!\_OS is in its infancy and warmly welcomes all ideas. Let’s foster collaboration, and actively seek participation from everyone involved with an understanding that we all want to make Pop\!\_OS awesome.

Both the development of the OS and the process it entails are to remain open, agile, and contributor-friendly - this includes the:
- Code of Conduct
- Development Roadmap
- Where and how feedback is provided
- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- General community contribution

To ensure a productive, open, vibrant community, here are a few ground rules:

1. Be considerate

   We depend on a variety of opinions and ideas to innovate. This is an open environment, be respectful of others’ ideas, even if you disagree with them.

2. Experiment

   We encourage participants to feel empowered to experiment when innovation could improve the project. When inspiration strikes, go for it! No need to wait for a lead to present itself.

3. Pass the ball.

   If you leave or disengage with a project, please take the proper steps to ensure that others know how/where to pick up where you left off.

   Similarly, if you are stuck, reach out. And remember that collaboration improves the quality of our work.

4. Assume good intentions

   To ensure this is a community where people feel comfortable to contribute productive criticism, thoughts, and ideas - assume that everyone here has good intention before we respond, or contribute to the group.

This Code is not complete. It is an inspirational guide to making awesome things together. It speaks to the core of the System76 environment, where smart people can make really cool things they love.
